# - explicitly opt out of trailing context lines (-A 0)
# Finally, use `head` to output only the first of the up-to-two lines output.

# - two lines were output, and we grabbed the immediately-smaller version, or
# - one line was output with only our version, because there was no immediately-smaller version,
